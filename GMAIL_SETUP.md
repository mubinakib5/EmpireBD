5. Click **Select app** ‚Üí **Other (Custom name)**
6. Enter "EmpireBD Website" as the name
7. Click **Generate**
8. **Copy the 16-character password** (you'll need this)

### Step 2: Configure Environment Variables

1. Create a `.env.local` file in your project root (if it doesn't exist)
2. Add these variables:

```bash
# Gmail Configuration
GMAIL_USER=your-email@gmail.com
GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD=your-16-character-app-password

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. Place a test order through your website
3. Check your email inbox for:
   - Customer confirmation email
   - Admin notification email

## üîß Configuration Options

### Environment Variables

| Variable             | Required    | Description                                                  |
| -------------------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `GMAIL_USER`         | ‚úÖ Yes      | Your Gmail address that will send emails                     |
| `GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD` | ‚úÖ Yes      | 16-character app password from Google                        |
| `ADMIN_EMAIL`        | ‚ùå Optional | Admin email for order notifications (defaults to GMAIL_USER) |
| `NEXTAUTH_URL`       | ‚úÖ Yes      | Your website URL                                             |

### Email Templates

The system includes two professional email templates:

1. **Customer Confirmation Email**
   - Order details and items
   - Shipping address
   - Order number for tracking
   - Professional EmpireBD branding

2. **Admin Notification Email**
   - Urgent alert styling
   - Complete order information
   - Customer contact details
   - Action items checklist

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**‚ùå "Invalid login" error**

- Make sure you're using the App Password, not your regular Gmail password
- Verify 2-Step Verification is enabled on your Google account

**‚ùå Emails not sending**

- Check your `.env.local` file has the correct variables
- Restart your development server after adding environment variables
- Check the browser console and server logs for error messages

**‚ùå "Email service not configured" error**

- Ensure `GMAIL_USER` and `GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD` are set in `.env.local`
- Make sure there are no extra spaces in your environment variables

### Testing Email Configuration

You can test your email configuration by visiting:

```
http://localhost:3001/api/emails/order-confirmation
```

This will show you the configuration status without sending emails.

## üîí Security Best Practices

1. **Never commit `.env.local`** - It's already in `.gitignore`
2. **Use App Passwords** - Never use your main Gmail password
3. **Limit App Password scope** - Create separate app passwords for different applications
4. **Regular rotation** - Consider rotating app passwords periodically

## üì± Production Deployment

When deploying to production (Vercel, Netlify, etc.):

1. Add the same environment variables to your hosting platform
2. Update `NEXTAUTH_URL` to your production domain
3. Test email functionality after deployment

## üé® Customization

To customize email templates, edit:

- `/lib/emailService.js` - Email templates and styling
- `/app/api/emails/order-confirmation/route.js` - Email sending logic

## üìû Support

If you encounter issues:

1. Check the troubleshooting section above
2. Review server logs for detailed error messages
3. Ensure all environment variables are correctly set

**üéâ That's it!** Your customers will now receive professional order confirmations, and you'll get instant notifications for new orders.
